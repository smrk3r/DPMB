# 802.11DPMB

**Don't Probe Me Bro** -- targeted 802.11 monitoring with law enforcement device detection

---

## What It Does

- Passive 802.11 beacon and probe request monitoring
- SSID watchlist with real-time alerts on detection
- Law enforcement / government device detection via SSID patterns and OUI fingerprinting
- Wireless intrusion detection (WIDS) — deauth floods, rogue APs, evil twin detection
- Network health monitoring with signal quality tracking
- Device tracking with first-seen/last-seen presence timeline
- Dual notification channels (ntfy.sh + Pushover) configurable from the dashboard
- Live web dashboard with guided onboarding tour
- WPA handshake capture (passive EAPOL collection, hc22000 for hashcat)
- Hidden SSID decloaking (passive correlation + active deauth)
- Auto-discovery of wireless interfaces — zero-config setup
- USB WiFi adapter hot-swap via udev auto-restart
- Daily heartbeat notifications

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Linux with a monitor-mode capable WiFi adapter
- Root access (required for monitor mode and raw packet capture)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smrk3r/DPMB.git
cd DPMB
sudo bash setup.sh
```

On first launch, DPMB auto-detects your wireless adapter and puts it into monitor mode. No manual interface configuration required.

## Configuration

Settings can be managed two ways:

1. **Dashboard UI** — click the gear icon to configure device and notification settings
2. **Config file** — edit `/etc/dpmb/config.toml` directly

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `device_id` | Unique identifier for this sensor | No (defaults to hostname) |
| `wifi_interface` | Wireless interface to use | No (auto-detected if blank) |
| `scan_interval_sec` | Seconds between scan cycles | No (default: 10) |
| `cooldown_min` | Minutes before re-alerting on the same SSID | No (default: 60) |
| `webhook_url` | Endpoint for detection alerts and heartbeats | Yes |
| `heartbeat_hour` | Hour of day (0-23) to send the daily heartbeat | No (default: 8) |
| `log_level` | Logging verbosity (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`) | No (default: info) |
| `db_path` | Path to the SQLite database file | No (default: `/var/lib/dpmb/events.db`) |

## Dashboard

The web dashboard runs on port 5000 with nine tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Health** | Network health overview — signal strength, channel utilization, AP stability |
| **Live** | Real-time probe request feed with MAC, SSID, RSSI, and channel |
| **WIDS** | Wireless intrusion detection alerts — deauth floods, rogue APs, evil twins |
| **Watchlist** | Manage watched SSIDs and owned networks |
| **Devices** | Tracked client devices with first-seen, last-seen, and vendor lookup |
| **Timeline** | Temporal view of device presence and activity patterns |
| **Neighbors** | Observed access points with SSID, BSSID, channel, signal, and encryption |
| **LE Activity** | Law enforcement / government device detections with confidence scores |
| **Intel** | SSID intelligence — hidden AP correlation, OUI analysis |

### First-Time Tour

On first visit, a guided 9-step tour walks through every dashboard feature. The tour can be restarted by clearing `dpmb_tour_completed` from browser localStorage.

### Settings

Click the gear icon to open the settings drawer:

- **Device** — device name, WiFi interface (auto-populated dropdown), scan interval, alert cooldown
- **ntfy.sh** — enable/disable, topic, server URL, test button
- **Pushover** — enable/disable, user key, application API token, test button

## Notifications

DPMB supports two push notification channels, configurable from the dashboard:

| Channel | Setup |
|---------|-------|
| **ntfy.sh** | Set a topic name. Free, no account required. Uses ntfy.sh by default or your own server. |
| **Pushover** | Enter your User Key and an Application API Token (register at pushover.net/apps). |

Both channels can be enabled simultaneously. Each notification type fires on both enabled channels.

### Alert Types

| Alert | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| Watchlist match | A watched SSID is detected in a beacon or probe |
| New device | A previously unseen client MAC appears |
| Deauth burst | Deauthentication flood detected (WIDS) |
| WIDS alert | Rogue AP, evil twin, or other wireless intrusion event |
| Health degradation | Signal quality drop, channel interference spike |
| LE signature | Law enforcement device pattern matched |
| Heartbeat | Daily status report (configurable hour) |
